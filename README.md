# LittleGame<br>

**A little game, if you please.** 

<br>There is a set of 64 (2^6) numbers. {0,1,2,..,61,62,63}	

Take 2^x numbers out of this set in turn. (alternating distance = 2^x).	

Do this 6 times, increment x by 1 each time. The starting value is in each case 2^x.

Interesting is here, always the first number. 

So if you think of a number, and the desired number is available in the corresponding set, then you simply always count the first number together.<br><br>

**Think of a number between 1 to 63<br>**<br>
